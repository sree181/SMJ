          "section_text": "My analysis revealed that devising strategies for social innovation involved the interplay of\nthe central and local leadership. The central leadership was responsible for articulating the\norganizational purpose in a formal mission. Local leaders crafted mission-oriented local initia-\ntives based on their understanding of local resources and needs and then bundled local\ninitiatives into strategies that reflected local interpretations of the mission. In turn, the central\nleadership legitimized these emergent strategies (Mintzberg, 1978; Mintzberg & Waters, 1985)\nand curated a repertoire of strategies for social innovation. The national organization distrib-\nuted a formal strategy tool kit among existing and prospective local leaders through strategizing\nepisodes (Hendry & Seidl, 2003), such as leader retreats and masterclasses. The tool kit gave\nexisting and prospective leaders an opportunity to borrow and recombine initiatives while con-\nsolidating their own local strategies. Because the national leadership celebrated the diversity of\nlocal strategies, local leaders accepted pluralistic strategies as part of the mission. Yet, alignment\nbetween local strategies and the organizational mission did not originate from clearly laid out\n3Following Webster's New World College Dictionary, I define mission-oriented local initiatives as new ideas or methods\noriginating from local actors' interpretation of an organization's mission and their desire to accomplish it. Webster's\nNew World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition (2004) defines an initiative as “the characteristic of originating new\nideas or methods.”\n350\nLEIBEL\n 10970266, 2025, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.3656 by Texas A&M International, Wiley Online Library on [17/03/2025].

Some scholars (e.g., Bartlett &\nGhoshal, 1994; Gulati, 2022; Ocasio et al., 2023) have argued that purpose precedes strategy and\nis the origin of organizational meaning and action. For instance, Ocasio et al. (2023, p. 124)\ndefined purpose as “institutionalized ideals, value-based aspirations guiding strategy and\naction.” Others have suggested that purpose guides strategy by reducing corporate myopia,"

One implicit process is that managers pursue\nsomething new (explore) because they value novelty, often because their existing options pro-\nduce results below their aspiration levels or because they have slack (Greve, 2003, 2007).

Indeed, citation counts of two founda-\ntional contributions provide some evidence of the KBV's acceptance in the strategic\nmanagement community: Grant (1996a) has been cited more than 27,000 times, and Kogut and\nZander (1992) over 21,000 times.1 The KBV's distinct identity lies in its assertion that knowledge\nis “the most strategically important of the firm's resources” (Grant, 1996a, p. 110; Conner &\nPrahalad, 1996; Spender, 1996).2 Knowledge is depicted as the strongest driver of competitive\nadvantage and serves as a “glue” that pulls resources together to create firm resource heteroge-\nneity, firm differences more generally, and, ultimately, high performance outcomes.3\nThis claim “that knowledge is the most important resource” has been widely accepted with-\nout a rigorous assessment of its validity.

We currently lack knowledge of\nwhether the KBV's distinguishing contention is true. Thus, we ask, “Is knowledge really the\nmost important strategic resource driving firm performance differentials?”\nWe test this question using a meta-analysis of study findings on the resource-performance\nrelationship reported during the period spanning1990 through 2022. Data from 348 samples\nreporting 248,136 firm-level observations reveal that knowledge is indeed the most important\nstrategic resource, as no other resource helps firms consistently realize competitive advantage\nand enjoy strong stock market, financial, and growth performance. In addition, knowledge is\n1Accessed on Google Scholar on June 25, 2024.\n2The term “strategic resource” developed in the resource-based view literature (Chi, 1994, p. 271). It refers to firm assets\nthat are valuable, scarce, and not easily copied or substituted (Barney, 1991). Such resources can be the basis for\ncompetitive advantage and strong performance (Barney et al., 2011).\n3The authors gratefully acknowledge an anonymous reviewer for this metaphor.\n4\nBERGH ET AL.\n 10970266, 2025, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.3645 by Texas A&M International, Wiley Online Library on [17/03/2025].

Knowledge resources have two different forms, explicit and implicit (Polanyi, 1966).\n\nExplicit knowledge \"is that which is written, easily communicated, and often contained in policies, procedures, or rules\" (Kacmar et al., 2006, p. 135). It can be declared and conceptualized (Polanyi, 1966), formalized and transferred (Ambrosini & Bowman, 2001), and \"is not specific or idiosyncratic\" to the one holding it (Sobol & Lei, 1994, p. 170). These properties suggest two sets of measures. Information systems and knowledge management systems are designated as explicit knowledge because they are formalized systems designed for the acquisition, storage, distribution, and retrieval of organizational knowledge and information (Adams & Lamont, 2003). Patents are intellectual property rights and capture explicit knowledge because they have been formalized and codified.\n\nTacit knowledge \"is not easily articulated and is acquired through practice\" and experiences (Kacmar et al., 2006, p. 135). Polanyi (1966) described tacit knowledge as practical knowledge acquired from personal and subjective experiences.

Data from 348 samples\nreporting 248,136 firm-level observations reveal that knowledge is indeed the most important\nstrategic resource, as no other resource helps firms consistently realize competitive advantage\nand enjoy strong stock market, financial, and growth performance. In addition, knowledge is\n1Accessed on Google Scholar on June 25, 2024.\n2The term “strategic resource” developed in the resource-based view literature (Chi, 1994, p. 271). It refers to firm assets\nthat are valuable, scarce, and not easily copied or substituted (Barney, 1991). Such resources can be the basis for\ncompetitive advantage and strong performance (Barney et al., 2011).\n3The authors gratefully acknowledge an anonymous reviewer for this metaphor.\n4\nBERGH ET AL.\n 10970266, 2025, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.3645 by Texas A&M International, Wiley Online Library on [17/03/2025].

          "section_text": "(Keith et al., 2013). Moreover, the “open systems” approach also highlights that liberals differ\nfrom conservatives in their perceptions of interdependencies between a firm and its environ-\nment (e.g., Chandler et al., 2023; Gupta & Briscoe, 2020). Liberals anticipate greater information\nexchange and potential spillovers from foreign to domestic firms, through the spread of new\ntechnologies and know-how, which can subsequently increase the productivity and competi-\ntiveness of the domestic industry (see generally Javorcik & Spatareanu, 2005). Thus, liberals will\nbe more likely to consider engagement with foreign actors to be ultimately beneficial to their\nin-group.\nGiven these differences, we expect judge ideology to moderate the bias against foreign firms\nin property rights disputes. Thus, we hypothesize that.\n248\nCHOUDHURY ET AL.\n 10970266, 2025, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.3658 by Texas A&M International, Wiley Online Library on [17/03/2025].

The difference in the likelihood of a domestic asset holder winning\na patent dispute against a foreign challenger compared to a similar dispute against a\ndomestic challenger is higher when adjudicated by a conservative judge.\nHypothesis 3b. The difference in the likelihood of a foreign asset holder winning a\npatent dispute against a domestic challenger when compared to a similar dispute\nagainst another foreign challenger is lower when adjudicated by a conservative judge.\n3\n|\nEMPIRICAL ANALYSIS\n3.1\n|\nContext: Patent disputes in US district courts\nOur empirical context is patent lawsuits in district courts of the United States, a country with\none of the strongest patent regimes globally (Ginarte & Park, 1997), and one which does not dif-\nferentiate between domestic and foreign firms. Judges in US district courts, enjoy high levels of\njudicial independence (World Economic Forum, 2016), and are protected by lifetime employ-\nment and high standards for impeachment. Patents are disputed in one of the 94 federal district\ncourts when (a) a firm believes the patent is invalid and should not have been granted in the\nfirst place, (b) patent holders' rights are believed to be infringed by another firm, and (c) the\npatent holder is not paid a royalty for the use of its patent. Whereas in (a) and (c) above, the\nchallenger is the plaintiff, in (b), the patent owner is the plaintiff.\n3.2\n|\nEmpirical strategy\nGiven the similar de jure protections, we examine if judges adjudicate patent lawsuits differ-\nently for foreign and domestic firms. To do so, we compare the probability that a domestic (for-\neign) patent holder wins a dispute against a foreign (domestic) challenger vis-à-vis another\ndomestic (foreign) challenger.\n3.3\n|\nData and variables\nWe acquired data from a variety of sources.

          "section_text": "Overconfidence differs from narcissism, a personality trait that refers to an individual's inflated view of one's self that requires constant validation from others (Chatterjee & Hambrick, 2007). While both narcissistic and overconfident CEOs have a preference for risk-taking (Gerstner et al., 2013), they differ in that narcissistic CEOs require constant attention and praise to reinforce their self-view, whereas overconfident CEOs are more likely to take on challenging projects without adequate preparation or support.\n\nOverconfidence is a personality trait that refers to an individual's tendency to believe they possess exceptional abilities, knowledge, or intelligence (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). It is characterized by a belief in one's own abilities and the confidence to take on challenging tasks without adequate preparation or support. Overconfident individuals are often seen as self-assured, optimistic, and confident in their decision-making abilities (Hambrick & Mason, 1984).\n\nOverconfidence can manifest in various ways, such as an excessive belief in one's own abilities, a tendency to take on challenging projects without adequate preparation or support, and a lack of humility. It is important to note that overconfidence can be both positive and negative (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). On the one hand, it can lead to innovative ideas and creativity, as well as increased confidence in decision-making abilities. On the other hand, it can also lead to poor judgment, impulsive behavior, and a lack of humility (Hambrick & Mason, 1984).\n\nOverconfidence is often seen as a positive trait, as it can lead to innovative ideas and creativity. However, it can also be detrimental if taken to an extreme, leading to poor judgment and impulsive behavior (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). It is important for individuals to recognize the signs of overconfidence and take steps to mitigate its negative effects. This may include seeking feedback from others, practicing humility, and taking a more cautious approach to decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, overconfidence is a personality trait that refers to an individual's tendency to believe they possess exceptional abilities, knowledge, or intelligence. It can manifest in various ways, such as an excessive belief in one's own abilities and a lack of humility. While it can be both positive and negative, it is important for individuals to recognize the signs of overconfidence and take steps to mitigate its negative effects."
