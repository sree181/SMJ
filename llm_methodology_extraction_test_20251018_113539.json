          "abstract": "This article develops a theoreti-cal framework to explicate how third parties, who are not transactionally involved in a given exchange relationship, can promote or impede the creation and capture of value by influencing market actor beliefs and behaviors. I investigate these issues empirically through an abductive mixed-method case study of the Michelin Guide's entry into New York City. An examination of two decades of the openings and closings of New York City's elite restaurants indicates that receiving a Michelin star corresponded to an increased likelihood of restaurant exit. Michelin stars appear to have fostered disruptions at recipients' upstream and downstream interfaces, which inhibited their ability to capture value. This ultimately underscores how value network reactivity to third-party evaluations may lead to unintended consequences for firms.",

The central leadership was responsible for articulating the organizational purpose in a formal mission. Local leaders crafted mission-oriented local initiatives based on their understanding of local resources and needs and then bundled local initiatives into strategies that reflected local interpretations of the mission. In turn, the central leadership legitimized these emergent strategies (Mintzberg, 1978; Mintzberg & Waters, 1985) and curated a repertoire of strategies for social innovation. The national organization distributed a formal strategy tool kit among existing and prospective local leaders through strategizing episodes (Hendry & Seidl, 2003), such as leader retreats and masterclasses. The tool kit gave existing and prospective leaders an opportunity to borrow and recombine initiatives while consolidating their own local strategies. Because the national leadership celebrated the diversity of local strategies, local leaders accepted pluralistic strategies as part of the mission.",

Having a strong mission can enhance both opportunity recognition and strategic alignment; however, aligning strategy and mission can be challenging when an organization pursues its social mission in pluralistic ways. How can mission-driven organizations manage pluralistic local initiatives while cohering to their missions? Using an inductive field study, I trace how Slow Money, a nonprofit supporting sustainable local food systems by connecting food entrepreneurs with local investors, translated its core mission into different mission-oriented local initiatives. I find that mission-oriented local initiatives were recombined to create novel strategies curated and diffused by the central leadership, and I show how, rather than derail an organization's mission, pluralistic local initiatives can foster strategies for social innovation.",

We examine this assertion through a meta-analysis of the accumulated evidence on the relationships among strategic resources and firm performance (stock market, financial performance, and growth). Findings from 348 samples reporting 248,136 firm-level observations show that knowledge resources have the highest positive association with all three performance dimensions, with the highest positive relationship with growth, followed by market and then financial performance. Further, knowledge may serve as a foundational resource by augmenting other strategic resources and helping make firms different. These findings support the KBV's core prediction that knowledge resources offer superior strategic value.",

In this study, we highlight internal and external advice seeking as underlying microfoundations of dynamic managerial capabilities for BMI and examine the mediating role of coordination flexibility capabili- ties (CFCs). With a survey dataset of 254 senior managers, our research reveals that external advice seeking capabilities positively influence BMI. Interestingly, the impact of internal advice seeking on BMI is fully mediated by CFC. Furthermore, our results indicate that the extent to which internal advice seeking impacts CFC is strengthened in firms with high levels of digitalization. Managerial Summary: While business model innova- tion (BMI) is often linked to the skills of managers, there is a lack of research exploring which particular skills actually drive BMI.

Using data from a survey of 254 senior managers, we found that seeking external advice has a positive impact on BMI. Surprisingly, the influence of seeking internal advice on BMI is only significant when firms have high CFC at the organizational level. Additionally, we discovered that the relationship between internal advice seeking and CFC is stronger in highly digitalized firms.",

Drawing on a qualitative comparative analysis of 1,395 crowdfunding campaigns, we identified different configurations of signals for high and low resource mobilization, theorizing abductively their underlying mechanisms through the analysis of case-level qualitative data. Our results explain some past mixed findings, such as the contradictory effects of social value and entrepreneurial narratives, showing that these narratives can instead be successfully combined in the presence of signals of venture quality and community embeddedness. We show that there is no single best way to impress resource holders, but multiple recipes to holistically communicate a venture's value.",

As the foundational tool for our analyses, we develop a granular decomposition of firm growth, which we apply to all US employer firms over 2004–2013 (61 million firm-year observations). Starting with the employment growth decomposition in HJM as the baseline, we split organic modes into growth from new establishments (or units), growth from existing units, and closures. We then make the decomposition more strategy-relevant by adding transactional modes (i.e., acquisitions and selloffs) and by decomposing growth from existing units further into growth from old units, recently set-up units, and recently acquired units. As a result, our decomposition measures seven growth modes in total.",

We address these using a comprehensive seven-mode decomposition of employment growth in all US firms (2004–2013). We find that organic modes such as opening or closing plants contribute more than transactional modes such as acquisitions and selloffs, and that growth modes exhibit age-size differences and are generally positively correlated within firms. Trade competition in manufacturing increased closures and decreased acquisitions but had no effect on new units. Transac-tional growth positively correlates with future survival, unlike organic growth. Together, our findings expand our understanding of firm growth as a composite of multiple growth modes.",

          "abstract": "Research Summary: Political and regulatory actors routinely adopt or enforce policies to protect domestic firms at the expense of foreign firms. However, since courts are expected to be neutral and act independently, a question arises whether (and why) they discriminate against foreign firms. We argue that the courts are nationalistic, which emanates from judges differentiating between in-group (domestic) and out-group (foreign) members. In a sample of 58,754 patent disputes adjudicated by US federal district courts between 1983 and 2016, we find domestic patent holders and challengers are more successful than their foreign counterparts. Rulings involving foreign firms are more likely to exhibit nationalistic rhetoric. Judicial ideology moderates the differential odds of success between domestic and foreign firms. Thus, the legal system is another source of economic nationalism.",

          "abstract": "Research Summary: When established firms source technology from specialized technology firms, extant research has typically assumed that this in-sourced technology is novel. We test this assumption by modeling in-sourcing decisions using a problem-solution lens wherein firms choose from available external technical solutions to solve their market problems. Since the locus of identification, evaluation, and selection of external solutions remains internal to the firm's R&D personnel, we argue that they frequently prefer familiar over novel solutions. We identify two factors that help firms overcome this preference for familiarity: when top managers focus their attention on the market problem or when they receive feedback from unexpected failures to solve that problem. Our case control analysis of 715 in-sourced emerging technological solutions in the biopharmaceutical industry offers broad support to our theoretical framework.",
