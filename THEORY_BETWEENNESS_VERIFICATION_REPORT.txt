THEORY BETWEENNESS TAB - DETAILED CALCULATION VERIFICATION REPORT
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Theory Betweenness tab identifies 'bridge theories' - theories that
connect multiple phenomena and research domains. This metric measures:
  - Cross-Topic Reach: Number of distinct phenomena each theory explains
  - Betweenness Score: Normalized measure of how theories connect domains
  - Bridge Theories: Theories explaining at least 2 phenomena (default)

SECTION 1: DATABASE VERIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Relationship Count:
  Total EXPLAINS_PHENOMENON relationships: 3643
  Distinct theories with relationships: 808
  Distinct phenomena explained: 1244

SECTION 2: CALCULATION LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Database Query:
  Query: MATCH (t:Theory)-[:EXPLAINS_PHENOMENON]->(ph:Phenomenon)
         WITH t, count(DISTINCT ph) as phenomenon_count,
              collect(DISTINCT ph.phenomenon_name) as phenomena
         WHERE phenomenon_count >= $min_phenomena
         RETURN t.name, phenomenon_count, phenomena
         ORDER BY phenomenon_count DESC
         LIMIT 100

2.2 Cross-Topic Reach Calculation:
  Cross-Topic Reach = count(DISTINCT ph) for each theory
  This counts how many distinct phenomena each theory explains

2.3 Betweenness Score Calculation:
  Step 1: Find maximum cross-topic reach: max_reach = max(all cross_topic_reach)
  Step 2: Normalize each theory: betweenness_score = cross_topic_reach / max_reach
  Range: [0, 1] where 1.0 = theory with maximum reach

2.4 Paper Count Calculation:
  Query: MATCH (p:Paper)-[:USES_THEORY]->(t:Theory)
         WHERE t.name IN $theory_names
         RETURN t.name, count(DISTINCT p) as paper_count

2.5 Summary Statistics:
  - Total Bridge Theories: count(theories with cross_topic_reach >= min_phenomena)
  - Avg Cross-Topic Reach: mean(cross_topic_reach) for all bridge theories
  - Max Cross-Topic Reach: max(cross_topic_reach) across all theories
